# Notes
On a mobile device, this is still functional, however ugly it may look. However, to expand your hand, click on your player name, not the cards, lest one of the cards be accidentally played or you hear that obnoxious buzzer noise.
Secondly, the card that looks like the copy symbol is Discard All (of one color) from UNO Attack.
Finally, it won't be obvious that it's possible, but click on the deck if you need to draw a card. It will automatically pass your turn after three cards are drawn. (idk if that's in the rules but it's how my fam and I play)

## Enjoy!!!
